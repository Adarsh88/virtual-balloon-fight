# virtual-balloon-fight
## What we are doing
We are building a virtual balloon fight game to fight the heat in this summer.
## What the user should do
Each user have to register their name and also their position in x,y coordinates. It will be then stored in the database. 
So after 2 or more users are in the database , we can start the game.
The user can then throw the water balloons by providing the x and y coordinates, the throw heading, strength and height(angle).
Once the balloon hits the user's x,y coordinates , it bleeps and informs the user that the vitctim is hit by the water balloon.
## How to run the game
1. Add your name and run the .game.sh

3. Then we have to throw heading, strength and height(angle). We will get the coordinates the balloon reached.

4. We shoot the water balloon till it hits a player. We can hear a bleep and a message is shown, if it hits a player.

5. We could actually shoot ourselves if we dont give any coordinates XD.
