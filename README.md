# virtual-balloon-fight
## What we are doing
We are building a virtual balloon fight game to fight the heat in this summer.
## What the user should do
Each user have to register their name and also their position in x,y coordinates. It will be then stored in the database. 
So after 2 or more users are in the database , we can start the game.
The user can then throw the water balloons by providing the x and y coordinates , the angle and the power.
Once the balloon hits the user's x,y coordinates , it informs the user that the vitctim is hit by the water balloon.
